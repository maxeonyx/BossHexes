Random hex modifiers for boss fights! Each boss fight rolls a set of random hexes that affect players and bosses for the duration of the fight.

Features:
- Flashy Hexes: dramatic effects like Invisible Boss, Meteor Shower, Unstable Gravity, Wing Clip
- Modifier Hexes: stat changes like Sluggish, Frail, Broken Armor, Swift Boss
- Constraint Hexes: restrictions like No Ranged Damage, No Grapple, Grounded

Hexes persist until the boss is defeated - respawning the same boss type keeps the same hex.

Fully configurable - enable/disable any hex category.
